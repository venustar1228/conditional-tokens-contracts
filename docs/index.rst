Gnosis Prediction Market Contracts Documentation
================================================

Collection of smart contracts for the Gnosis prediction market platform (https://www.gnosis.pm).
To interact with those contracts have a look at (https://github.com/gnosis/pm-js).

Install
-------
Install requirements with npm:

``npm install``

Testing and Linting
-------------------
Run all tests (requires Node version >=7 for `async/await`, and will automatically run TestRPC in the background):

``npm test``

Run all tests matching a regexp pattern by setting the `TEST_GREP` environment variable:

``TEST_GREP='short selling' npm test``

Lint the JS:

``npm run lint``

Compile and Deploy
------------------
These commands apply to the RPC provider running on port 8545. You may want to have TestRPC running in the background. They are really wrappers around the [corresponding Truffle commands](http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/commands).

Compile all contracts to obtain ABI and bytecode:

``npm run compile``

Migrate all contracts required for the basic framework onto network associated with RPC provider:

``npm run migrate``

Network Artifacts
-----------------

Show the deployed addresses of all contracts on all networks:

``npm run networks``

Command line options for `truffle` can be passed down through NPM by preceding the options list with `--`.

For example, to clean network artifacts:

``npm run networks -- --clean``

Network artifacts from running migrations will contain addresses of deployed contracts on the Kovan and Rinkeby testnets.

Take network info from `networks.json` and inject it into contract build artifacts. This is done prepublish as well:

``npm run injectnetinfo``

Extract all network information into `networks.json`:

Be aware that this will clobber `networks.json`, so be careful with this command:

``npm run extractnetinfo``

Gas Measurements
----------------

Log gas measurements into `build/gas-stats.json`:

``npm run measuregasstats``

Documentation
-------------

There is a copy version hosted online at https://gnosis.github.io/pm-contracts/

Build docs with doxity:

``scripts/makedocs.sh``
